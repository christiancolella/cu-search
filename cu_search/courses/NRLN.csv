NRLN 2000,Ways of Knowing: Constructions of Knowledge in the Academy and Beyond,"This course asks students to interrogate natural learning tendencies, how they know what they know, and how to cultivate other ways of knowing beyond intellectual. They analyze how knowledge is created, discovered, and interpreted. TheyÂ¿ll explore what faculties are involved in learning, seeing, understanding and knowing; how revolutions in knowledge arise; the relationship between knowledge and power; and what wisdom is. Students draw on different ways of expressing knowledge, including the intellect, intuition, and more. Department consent required. "
NRLN 3500,Constructions of Knowledge in the Fields,"This course invites students to investigate how their fields construct knowledge and are constructed. Its interdisciplinarity encourages them to think critically about all dimensions of the field, from its ancient history to breaking news, its working theories to working conditions, its major controversies to the politics and passions that fuel them. Through theory, case study, film, and more, students come to see their fields as ways of knowing, living, working, and engaging in the world. Department consent required."
