ARCH 2100,Studio 1: Foundations of Architecture,"The beginning of the architectural specialization sequence, this course introduces students to the basic strategies and techniques of architectural design. This studio focuses on concepts of medium-scale building design, siting, and climate. Through multiple design exercises, students learn how these factors assist in shaping buildings. "
ARCH 2115,Architecture Materials and Methods,"An introduction to both standard and innovative building materials this course exposes students to the elements and processes used to in constructing buildings. Through lecture, technical drawing, material research and exposure to practicing professionals, students build a foundation of knowledge necessary to approach the specification and design of materials as well as to foster a curiosity in the innovative frontiers of assembly, aesthetics and sustainable life-cycle considerations. "
ARCH 3100,Studio 2: Intermediate Architecture,"Dealing with problems at an intermediate level of complexity this architecture studio emphasizes the interaction of form, programmatic use, human behavior and context in creating structure. Studio options may include a client-based community engaged project, real world applications, and/or result in a physical product. Students work across analog and digital platforms to produce high quality and portfolio-worthy work. "
ARCH 3114,History and Theory of Architecture 1,"Focusing on buildings, this lecture is a survey of the built environment starting with some of the first structures built by humans and moving through time to the Industrial Revolution. The course focuses on the development of major styles, influential people, and the drivers of building form. "
ARCH 3214,History and Theory of Architecture 2,"Picking up after the Industrial Revolution and continuing through to todayÂ¿s Contemporary Architecture this course is the sequel to History and Theory I. History be taught thematically and cover important structures, key figures, and movements that have shaped our modern world. "
ARCH 4010,Architectural Appreciation and Design,Introduces basic processes and principles of architectural design. Provides a basis for understanding and evaluating architecture.
ARCH 4100,Studio 3: Capstone in Architecture,"The capstone of the studio sequence, this course investigates building technology, structural systems, user experience, and environmental sustainability. Studio options may include a client-based community engaged project, real world applications, and/or result in a physical product. Outcomes include well developed structures designed with a high level of craft, resulting in sophisticated and exhibit-worthy presentations. "
ARCH 4115,Architecture Building Technology,"Through experimentation and testing, the fundamentals of building physics and climate science are taught in this interactive seminar. Students learn the concepts related to structural and mechanical systems necessary for proper building function by first studying and then implementing the key systems through hypothetical building assignments. This class covers active and passive green building systems that are necessary when designing structures for an evolving climate."
