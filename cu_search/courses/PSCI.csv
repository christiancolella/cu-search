PSCI 7126,Introduction to Public Policy,"Designed for graduate students specializing in the field of public policy in the political science program. Surveys a wide variety of approaches to the analysis and understanding of public policy. The course is not a survey of any particular set of substantiative policy areas but instead is intended as an examination of the enduring puzzles that analysts of public policy commonly confront, the kinds of research methodologies that they employ, and a selection of the techniques that they bring to bear on their research questions."
PSCI 7131,Political Psychology,"Focuses on the psychological roots of political behavior, including the origins of political beliefs, political decision-making processes, and the psychology of group interactions."
PSCI 7132,Comparative Political Economy,"Explores the relationship between economics and politics in developed and developing countries.

"
PSCI 7136,Public Policy and Behavioral Science,"Public policy is usually designed with the assumption that we make optimal choices based on our own best interests. Findings from the behavioral sciences, however, challenge this traditional view and reveal that a wide array of factors influence our decisions. In this course, we will explore the gaps between how we assume individuals to behave and how people actually behave. With better knowledge of what motivates human behavior, we will examine and discuss how policy might be better designed and executed to improve outcomes in society."
PSCI 7143,Strategic Choice of Political Conflict,"Explores the conditions under which political actors go to war, and the conditions under which they broker peace. Approaches political conflict from the perspective of strategic choice. Conflict is not an accident, but is the deliberate result of decisions by actors. Actors choose conflict when bargaining obstacles prevent them from reaching a peaceful agreement."
PSCI 7145,Advanced Game Theory,"Covers more advanced applications of game theory in political science. Equips students with the skills to design and solve models at a reasonably high level of complexity and generality, and to understand how to effectively make use of such models in their research."

Considers three bodies of literature: American federalism and intergovernmental relations, state politics, and urban/local politics. Also examines a number of policy issues."
PSCI 7155,Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Generalized Linear Models,"Introduces maximum likelihood estimation and extends the linear model to several generalized linear models. Provides students with the skills to analyze and understand a broad class of outcome variables and data structures such as dichotomous outcomes, counts, ordered and unordered categorical outcomes and bounded variables. Also examines several special topics such as multilevel models, causal inference and missing data."
PSCI 7165,Experimental Methods,"Focuses on the design, implementation, and analysis of experiments in political science, including lab experiments, survey experiments, and field experiments."
PSCI 7171,Seminar: Law and Democratic Governance,"Explores cutting-edge debates in election law. Studies different perspectives on the current controversies in the field, in addition to select opportunities to engage scholars directly about their work. Develops students' understanding of the law of democracy, exposing students to some of the best scholarship, and improving students' ability to evaluate and critique legal scholarship. "
PSCI 7172,Comparative Political Institutions,"Institutional theory has burgeoned across the social sciences in the last three decades. This course aims to raise awareness and understanding of institutional theory in comparative politics, as compared to alternative approaches such as political economy, political behavior, etc., and to help students develop skills to communicate this awareness and understanding to other professional political scientists."
PSCI 7173,The Politics of International Factor Flows,"Focuses on the second dimension of international trade: the politics of international factor flows. Economic globalization can be defined as the freer flow of (1) goods and services (i.e., international trade) and (2) factors of production (e.g., capital and labor) across national borders. Links these topics in International Political Economy to broader theories of International Relations, namely Institutionalism and Liberalism."
PSCI 7175,Dissertation Seminar,"Help students make progress towards (1) in the short term: focusing in on a dissertation topic, crafting a dissertation prospectus, and identifying potential funding sources; and (2) in the long term: sending papers out for review, developing a package for the job market, and understanding the academic job market and the tenure process."
PSCI 7181,Immigration Law and Immigrants' Rights,"Addresses four broad questions: Who is a citizen of the United States? Who else can come to this country? When and why can noncitizens be forced to leave? Who has the authority to answer these questions? These questions prompt us to examine the history of U.S. immigration, the constitutional-statutory-regulatory framework that governs immigration and citizenship law and the federal agencies that administer it. Also addresses contemporary challenges to, and assertions of, immigrants' rights. "
PSCI 7183,International Cooperation,"Investigates the origins, forms and consequences of international cooperation. The course covers both theoretical material related to international cooperation and various related global issue areas; security, economy, environment and social welfare. For each issue area, the key theoretical debates, empirical findings, as well as central challenges and parameters that constrain international cooperation will be investigated."
PSCI 7185,Political Network Analysis,"Explores all aspects of political network analysis including disciplinary background, theories and concepts, approaches and applications, data basics and measurement, and techniques of analysis. Data assignments use software such as UCINET and R. Introduces visualization software including NetDraw, NetworkX and Cytoscape."
PSCI 7191,Law and Politics Colloquium: Race in America,"A co-taught colloquium that exposes students to highly prominent scholars conducting research on current topics at the intersection of race, social science and the law, including racial profiling, hate crime and affirmative action. Students will complete a final paper satisfying the CU Law seminar requirement. "
PSCI 7203,Political Economy of International Migration and Policy,"Provides an overview of the seminal and cutting edge research on the political economy of international migration including both immigration and emigration. Covers a diverse set of international migration issues, including public attitudes toward immigration, special interest politics of immigration policy making and the dynamics between political institutions and international migration."
PSCI 7206,Public Policy and the Governance of Natural Resources,"Addresses a basic empirical puzzle in comparative environmental policy: why are some governmental organizations able to create relatively functional governance arrangements for natural resources management, while many others fail to do so? More specifically, we will seek to understand the particular contextual conditions that make successful governance transformations more likely."
PSCI 7222,Comparative Political Behavior,Provides an introduction to research on behavioral processes and outcomes using readings mainly from the sub-fields of American Politics and Comparative Politics. Geographic emphasis leans toward advanced democracies because this is how behavioral research has generally developed but will also explore works by developing country experts. The main goals are to help students become familiar with the existing literature and to help them explore several key debates in the field.
PSCI 7255,Time Series and Pooled Time Series,"Time series models¿models which take advantage of variation over time in a single unit¿and pooled time series (sometimes called cross-sectional time series or time series cross-sectional) models¿which utilize variation across both time and spatial units¿are very common in political science. While these models offer substantial leverage over important social science problems that use purely cross-sectional data, there are a number of pitfalls that are necessary to avoid during estimation. "
PSCI 7306,Program Evaluation,"Focuses on applying the tools of causal inference and program evaluation to various policy issues. The course materials explore whether programs meet their desired goals. There are a number of ways in which the ¿effectiveness¿ of a program can be defined and measured. Empirical applications based on real-world data will be drawn from a wide range of policy areas, including education, welfare, unemployment, discrimination, health, immigration, the environment, and economic development. Previously offered as a special topics course."
