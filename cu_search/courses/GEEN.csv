GEEN 1010,Engineering Explorations Through Physics,"Explore the world of engineering through understanding physics concepts, engaging in active learning assignments, and conducting hands-on labs and experiments. Students will analyze product designs and engineering decisions based on the physics surrounding the situation. Formerly COEN 1010."
GEEN 1017,Engineering Drawing,"Introduces CAD software; relevant concepts, including orthographic projection, sections, engineering drawing, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing; and rapid manufacturing methods. Final design project involves rapid prototyping. Not recommended for AREN majors."
GEEN 1400,Engineering Projects,"First-year students solve real engineering design problems in interdisciplinary teams. Design projects vary by section. Curriculum focuses on iterative design process, teamwork and team dynamics, supporting design with testing and analysis, and technical writing. Completed projects are exhibited at an end-of-semester design expo. Students responsible for contributing towards their design project budget and poster costs, and purchasing safety glasses (approximately $75)."
GEEN 2400,Engineering Projects for the Community,"Design engineering products for local community clients, with emphasis on humanitarian engineering and integrated systems with electrical, mechanical, and software components. Students are challenged to take design projects to a higher level by requiring an additional iteration through the design cycle and more engaged user-testing, in order to infuse student projects with the robustness necessary for public-use products."
GEEN 2851,Statics for Engineers,"Examines vector treatment of force systems and their resultants; equilibrium of frames and machines, including internal forces and three-dimensional configurations; static friction; properties of surfaces, including first and second moments; hydrostatics; and minimum potential energy and stability. "
GEEN 3010,Circuits for Engineers,"Examines basic concepts of electricity, digital systems, circuit analysis, and circuit design. Specific topics covered include analysis of electric circuits by use of Ohm's law, network reduction, node and loop analysis, Thevenin and Norton theorems, DC and AC signals, transient response of simple circuits, basic diode and transistor circuits, operational amplifiers, and microcontrollers. Students are challenged to integrate their knowledge in a final design project."
GEEN 3024,Materials Science for Engineers,"Examines structure, properties, processing and uses of metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite materials. Specific topics covered include perfect and imperfect solids, phase equilibria, transformation kinetics, mechanical and electrical behavior and failure modes. Approach incorporates both materials science and materials engineering applications. Formerly GEEN 2024."
GEEN 3400,Invention and Innovation,"Introduction to business development and product innovation with a hands-on approach. Students explore the invention process, hone their engineering design skills, and explore the initial stages of entrepreneurship (patenting, intellectual property, marketing research, and raising capital). Student teams design, create, and test a commercial product, and exhibit at an end-of-semester design expo."
GEEN 3830,Special Topics,Explores topics of interest in engineering. Content varies by instructor and semester.
GEEN 3852,Thermodynamics for Engineers,"Explores fundamental concepts and basic theory, including first and second laws of thermodynamics, properties, states, thermodynamic functions and cycles. Links theory and application with labs and a design project involving a functioning thermodynamic process. "
GEEN 3853,Data Analysis for Engineers,"Learn to design and execute experiments and analyze the results. Topics covered include measurement fundamentals, design of experiments, elementary statistics and uncertainty analysis. Topics include probability, error propagation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, linear regression, one- and two-factor ANOVA and time series analysis. "
GEEN 4400,Teaching Design,"Examines teaching engineering design to a variety of audiences including secondary schools, project teams, and other communities. Students examine the process of teaching hands-on design including scoping, stages of team evolution, and iteration. Students also explore different design methods, the development of engineering identity, and the interface between engineering and society. Students practice integrating design thinking into local schools and companies, develop ready-to-use tools and resources, and explore the design education literature."
GEEN 4848,Independent Study,Subjects arranged in consultation with instructor and undergraduate advisor. Department consent required.
