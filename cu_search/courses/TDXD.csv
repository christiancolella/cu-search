The first in three-part sequence on graphic representation and expressive practices, students will learn how to work out design ideas through sketching, drawing, creating storyboards and collages."
TDXD 5700,Experience Design Atelier 2: Introduction to Design Graphics,"Introduces students to advanced techniques for representing design ideas in graphic form including commonly used software applications (Sketchup, Vectorworks, AutoCAD), scale modeling, mechanical drawing and rendering. The second in a three-part class sequence on graphic representation and expressive practices, this atelier will offer a range of exercises tailored to the skill level of individual students."
TDXD 5805,Professional Portfolio 1,"Focuses on selecting, organizing and developing a plan for presenting material that will eventually culminate in the completion of a competitive professional portfolio, a vital tool for gaining employment in the Experience Design industry. The first of a two-part credited final project, students begin the process to prepare their professional portfolio under the guidance of faculty and industry professionals. "
TDXD 6105,Collaboratory in Experience Design 2,"Introduces students to professional models of working in the Experience Design industry. The second in a two-part class sequence, students work collaboratively on industry case studies focusing on entertainment, education and cultural destination genres with input from outside professionals in the field."
TDXD 6210,Storytelling for XD,"Explores multi-modal, expressive strategies for experimental storytelling and investigates the diverse languages of live experience. Students complete projects using varying modes of conveyance including physical and spatial action, filmic approaches, digital media and alternative methods. Students will discuss current trends in expressive methods and the nature of story."
TDXD 6500,Experience Design Atelier 3: Packaging the Design Presentation,"Investigates strategies for visually communication and selling design ideas in a compelling and well composed visual/aural presentation. The third in a three-part sequence on graphic representation and expressive practices, this class culminates I a final, comprehensive design project portfolio that follows current professional standards."
TDXD 6555,Experience Design Technology,"Explores established and cutting-edge technologies employed in visual, auditory, and interactive elements of designed environments and experiences. Develops an understanding of the function of these areas, the ways in which they facilitate a complete experience and examines new directions of experimentation in these fields. Elicits research, analysis, and development of new concepts in response to current practices and design problems."
TDXD 6805,Professional Portfolio 2,"Through editing materials collected in TDXD 5805, students will complete adaptable versions (hard copy, digital, web-based and presentations) of their professional portfolios. In this second of a two-part credited project, a committee comprised of faculty and industry professionals guide the completion of XD portfolios. "
