BMEN 1000,Exploring Biomedical Engineering,"Introduces the biomedical engineering profession, curriculum, career pathways, ethics and responsibilities, and research opportunities. Academic and industry speakers are invited to address various biomedical engineering topics. "
BMEN 1025,Computer-Aided Design & Fabrication,"Introduces engineering drawing techniques through an modern computer aided design (CAD) software, and fabrication of some of these designs. The course will begin with an introduction of spatial visualization skills, then an in-depth introduction to Solidworks, an industry standard CAD software tool, along with introduction to fabrication processes including laser cutting, 3D printing, casting and injection molding, and 3D scanning will be completed. Additional topics include geometric design and tolerancing techniques and design for manufacturing."
BMEN 2000,Introduction to Biomedical Engineering,"Reviews concepts from molecular and cellular biology. Establishes important aspects of human physiology and engineering principles to develop a basic understanding of the biomedical engineering field. Introduces topics such as biomechanics, bioinstrumentation, bioimaging and biotechnology."
BMEN 2010,Biomaterials,"Introduces the science and engineering of biomaterials, with an emphasis on biomechanical aspects. Addresses the design, fabrication, testing, applications and performance of synthetic and natural materials that are used in a wide variety of biomedical prosthetics, implants and devices. In addition to attending lectures, students will conduct a laboratory experiment and a case study. "
BMEN 3010,Biotransport,"An introduction to the modeling of complex biological systems using principles of transport phenomena and biochemical kinetics. Includes the conservation of mass and momentum; rheology of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids; steady and transient diffusion in reacting systems; dimensional analysis; homogeneous versus heterogeneous reaction systems; and physiological transport systems, including oxygen and drug transport.
