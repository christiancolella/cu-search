LAND 2004,History of Landscape Architecture,"This course evolves through three phases of history. First, ancient history and the roots of the human relationship to nature and the origins of the `AnthropoceneÂ¿. Second, early history when shifting perspectives on the human relationship to the built and natural environment impacted design. Third, modern thinking in landscape architecture, take a glimpse into where we are heading, while maintaining a connection to the thousands of years that have brought us here. "
LAND 2100,Studio 1: Foundations of Landscape Architecture,"Introduces essential landscape architecture skills through a project-based studio, builds on design literacy, incorporates varied ecological processes, explores landscape as a medium for connecting the natural and cultural, develops analog and digital communication tools and focuses on the importance of place-making. "
LAND 3003,"Site Planning, Materials, and Technologies","Introduces the site analysis and planning process, and focuses on landscape architectural materials, landform manipulation, and green infrastructure technologies. Students learn to solve basic grading problems, specify and adapt green infrastructure technologies, and represent materials and details following construction-documentation drawing standards. Recommend Corequisite: LAND 3100."
LAND 3100,Studio 2: Intermediate Landscape Architecture,"Building on skills established in Studio A, this studio advances the understanding of the practice of landscape architecture by incorporating projects through community engagement or other real-world applications. This studio builds on the digital technologies and drawing and graphic communication skills. Repeatable for up to 12 total credit hours."
LAND 3103,Ecological Planting Design,"This class introduces plant identification and planting design and the significance the plants play in placemaking, bringing nature into urban environments, and stormwater management. Students will learn a solid base of native and naturalized Colorado plant identification and selection which can be used to attract pollinators, reflect light, build space in winter and other nuanced design practices. This class will also cover planting design principles and the tools used to create planting plans. "
LAND 4100,Capstone in Landscape Architecture,"Building on skills established in 2nd Studio, the studio refines the student's practice of landscape architecture through a design-build project or other applied, hands-on design project. The studio introduces critical concepts, strategies and advanced technical skills in order to address the pressing issues that can be addressed through landscape architecture."
LAND 4114,Landscape Architecture Theory,"Examines the bodies of theory that inform the landscape architecture discipline from aesthetic, ecological and social perspectives. It also covers design principles and further analyses of the projects that define landscape architecture."
