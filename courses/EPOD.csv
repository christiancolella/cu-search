EPOD 2004,History and Theory of Environmental Products of Design,"Provides a general overview of the theories that inform design, while focusing on 20th century history and theory around the making of products. "
EPOD 2100,Studio 1: Foundations of Environmental Products of Design,"Immersive, project based studio environment where students focus on the design of products at a human scale with an emphasis on more advanced 3D modeling, parametric design, advanced visualization, and file-to-factory fabrication methods. "
EPOD 3100,Studio 2: Intermediate Environmental Products of Design,"Introduces students to innovative emerging technologies and techniques in digital fabrication and design through a project-based studio environment. Students will be asked to develop design solutions that could be leveraged to benefit humanity through material investigations, cradle-to-cradle methodology, and more advanced methods in design optimization. Repeatable for up to 12 total credit hours."
EPOD 3101,Theory and Ethics in Design,"This course will introduce students to provocative theories and ideas as they relate to design, sustainability and the current zeitgeist and their relation to the complex ethical considerations in which designers engage. The course will endeavor students to reflect upon critical design theorists views as they work towards enunciating their own values and ideals as they relate to the practice of design."
EPOD 3105,Human Centered Design and Entrepreneurship Strategies,Exposes students to innovation and entrepreneurial practices around the topic of Environmental Products of Design through human/user centered design strategies.
EPOD 4012,EPOD Capstone Proposal Seminar,"Exposes students to research and development methodologies related to Environmental Products of Design. Students conduct thorough analysis of a user base, asses environmental impact of their design idea while developing a strategy for branding and fabrication. Finally, a proposal for a design solution of an identified problem is be presented which sets the thematic groundwork for the final Capstone Studio, EPOD 4100."
EPOD 4100,Studio 3: Capstone in Environmental Products of Design,"Expanding on the design research presented in the Capstone Proposal course, students fully develop and build an innovative prototype of their design solution."
EPOD 4115,Materials and Manufacturing Processes in Product Design,"This course explores the creation of products through an environmental lens as they relate to Material Science, Manufacturing Methods and Production Systems. The course will investigate innovative alternative materials and production approaches that improve upon pre-existing materials and paradigms. This includes sustainable materials, advanced production techniques at a variety of scales and a thorough understanding of the environmental cost incurred in the creation of products."
