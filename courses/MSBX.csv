Additional topics include tax consequences of investment decisions and cash management."
MSBX 5310,Customer Analytics,"Provides a deep understanding of how to use data on customer behavior and preferences to inform managerial decision making. Introduces methods for causal inference, modeling consumer demand, and modeling firm decisions. Applications include long-run customer management decisions (customer acquisition and retention) and short-run marketing mix (product, price, promotion and distribution) decisions. The R programming language is used for course examples and assignments. Students are assumed to have a working knowledge of R and linear regression techniques."
MSBX 5311,Customer Analytics,"Provides a deep understanding of customer centricity and its implications for the firm; state-of-the art methods for calculating customer lifetime value and customer equity; analytical and empirical skills that are needed to judge the appropriateness, performance, and value of different statistical techniques that can be used to address a issue around customer acquisition, development, and retention. Students will use their knowledge of R programming in this course."
MSBX 5405,Structured Data Modeling and Analysis,"Explores both the functional and technical environment for the creation, storage and use of the most prevalent source and type of data for business analysis, ERP and related structured data. Students will learn how to access and leverage information via SQL for analysis, aggregation to visualization, create dashboards, and be source for business intelligence."
MSBX 5410,Fundamentals of Data Analytics,"Exposes the students to commonly used platforms for statistical and predictive analytics. The class will go into depth of analytics using R before demonstrating the same concepts using SPSS and SAS. Students will learn to analyze large datasets, including textual analytics such as twitter-stream analysis using R."
MSBX 5415,Advanced Data Analytics,Explores the capabilities and challenges of data-driven business decision making and prepares students to lead in analytics-driven organizations. Introduces a set of common predictive and prescriptive analytics tools. Students apply the analytics tools to important decisions based on practical data sets from various companies. Analytics software packages are used extensively in the course.
MSBX 5420,Unstructured and Distributed Data Modeling and Analysis,"Moves the student beyond structured data and sources into business scenarios where data is semi-structured to unstructured such as those from social and web applications. Specific topics include introduction to SQL-on-Hadoop, NoSQL and related distributed processing technologies. Students will learn practical application and mechanisms for getting this sort of data ready for analytics."
MSBX 5430,Advanced Statistical Analysis,"Introduces advanced multivariate regression analysis and residual diagnostics, logistic regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA and MANOVA), time series models, and analysis of categorical variables. R, an open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics, will be used. It is assumed students have mastery of introductory statistics topics including descriptive tools, inference, and ordinary least squares regression."
MSBX 5435,Planning and Production,"At the core of GDP and productivity is the science of planning new products of services in design, bringing them to market then producing and replicating it in reliable, dependable, scalable fashion. The course takes an in-depth look at the mechanisms for supporting new product/process design in a scaled, often world-wide supply chain. (MRP, Six Sigma, Modeling Software, Heuristic Model use)."
MSBX 5440,Decision Analysis,"Covers both behavioral/psychological aspects and analytical approaches to making decisions with multiple objectives. The focus for the course is learning to frame decisions that involve multiple stakeholders with multiple objectives and then learning the various techniques used to evaluate the choices. Influence diagrams, decision heuristics using spreadsheets, and decision trees will all be explored with user-friendly decision tree software."
MSBX 5450,Transportation and Logistics,"Examines critical elements of distribution and logistics management, including physical distribution, supply chain echelon planning, warehouse (transportation note) selection and location, material handling, inventory quantity and location and other topics."
MSBX 5470,Procurement and Contracting,"Examines principles and concepts of the acquisition process from commercial and governmental perspectives, focusing on the procurement process, including planning, source selection, solicitation writing, negotiations and oral discussions, contract preparation and administration."
MSBX 5480,Information Security Management,"A broad introductions to the managerial issues of information security. Because security is multifaceted, the topics of the class range widely, including technical (e.g., cryptography), managerial (e.g., policy compliance), physical (e.g., door locks), and psychological (e.g. social engineering) issues. A key objective of the class is to develop a security mindset, in which one learns to think like an attacker for ways to exploit a system."
MSBX 5500,Security Analytics with Python and Machine Learning,"Explores the application of data analytics to the domain of information security. Project-based class using python machine learning libraries to both build and deploy models for both supervised and unsupervised modeling algorithms. Business problem contexts include classifying the likelihood that a file or website is malicious based on either extracted static indicators or dynamic behavioral analysis (predictive analytics), as well as network anomaly detection on organizational network traffic data or on user account usage (unsupervised machine learning). Master of Business Admin (MBAD), MBA w/ Dual Degree (DMBA), Joint Juris Doctor/MBA (JMBA), Profl MBA Program (PMBA) can seek departmental approval to enroll upon demonstration of data networking and modeling capabilities."
MSBX 5605,Real Estate Investment and Risk Management,"Examines strategies for mitigating the legal, property and portfolio risks associated with income properties. The course begins by examining risks created by leases. The course then analyzes the risks associated with a single property and examines how risk changes with portfolios containing multiple properties. Finally, the course examines how to optimally incorporate investment properties in mixed asset portfolios."
MSBX 5680,Real Estate Technology,"Course objectives are: (1) to understand economic forces that bridge technology, entrepreneurship and real estate; (2) to investigate short-, medium-, and lung-run effects of technology on residential and commercial real estate; (3) to communicate this information to Leeds School of Business students; and (4) to give current students the technology skills necessary to immediately add value for their potential employers."
