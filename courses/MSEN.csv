MSEN 5000,Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering,Discusses fundamental topics in materials science and engineering.
MSEN 5064,Soft Machines,"Introduces soft machines as a new paradigm of engineering that starts to impact healthcare, consumer electronics, renewable energy and collaborative robotics. Prepares students to participate in research on soft machines by starting with fundamentals of soft materials and by covering soft robotics, stretchable electronics, energy harvesting and functional polymers. Includes guest lectures, a literature review and a hands-on lab project. "
MSEN 5370,Materials Thermodynamics,"Reviews thermodynamics fundamentals and applies them to understand the chemical, thermal and mechanical behavior of materials. Examines equations of state, solution theory, equilibrium diagrams and phase changes."
MSEN 5430,Transmission Electron Microscopy in Materials Science & Engineering,"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as a powerful characterization tool in materials science. It is aimed at beginners and intermediate users of TEM and covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of advanced electron microscopy techniques. By taking this course, students will be able to interpret and analyze TEM data and understand electron microscopy publications. Students will learn the necessary theoretical basis for taking practical training on modern aberration-corrected TEMs. Previously offered as a special topics course. Recommended Prerequisite: Experience on electron microscopy is recommended but not necessary."
MSEN 5470,Materials Composition and Structure,"The synthesis, organization, and processing of materials can enable functional performance. Curriculum will overview the synthesis and design of functional organic and inorganic materials. A particular emphasis will be placed on structure-performance correlations between chemistry and materials organization. Topical foci will include polymers, biomaterials, and materials for energy."
